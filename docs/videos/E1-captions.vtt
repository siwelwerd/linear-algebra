00:00:06.103 --> 00:00:14.103
So to begin with, I have written down a vector equation. So here we have some scalar variables, x1 x2, x3.

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:18.853
Each one of them is multiplied by vector, and we add them together.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:23.093
Then we have this set equal to another vector.

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:31.103
So to make sense in this in another way, we can use our usual vector operations so we can multiply our scalars into our vectors.

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:38.103
And we write this as. Say one x1, three x1.

00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:59.103
Negative four x1 for the first one. And similarly for the other two.

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:05.103
And of course, that will still be equal to negative one, negative two, zero.

00:01:05.103 --> 00:01:11.103
And now we can apply vector addition. So we just add up each component.

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:16.103
So on top we get x1, two x2 plus three x3.

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:21.103
Second part we get three x1; that's four x3.

00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:30.103
And in the bottom part, we have negative four x1 plus seven x2 minus five x3.

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:38.453
And we're still equal to negative one, negative two, zero.

00:01:38.453 --> 00:01:42.103
Now, two vectors are going to be equal exactly when all of their components are equal.

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:46.103
So what this tells us is that those first two components better be equal.

00:01:46.103 --> 00:01:56.103
In other words, x1 plus two x2 plus three x3 has to equal negative one for these two vectors to be equal.

00:01:56.103 --> 00:02:03.103
And also, we have to have three x1 plus four x3 equal to negative two.

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:10.103
And we need to add negative four x1 seven x2 to minus five x3.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:21.983
That needs to be equal to zero. So our single vector equality turned into this system of three scalar equations.

00:02:21.983 --> 00:02:29.103
Now, the last piece of this is that we typically write these in the same way.

00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:38.103
Just by using the layout on the page to tell us what each thing is, so you notice I've lined up all the x1's here.

00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:43.103
And kind of crookedly, tried to light up all the x2's and then our x3's as well over here.

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:51.103
So we just know that the first column goes with the x1's we get this in augmented matrix form.

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:55.103
So the first column represents the next one second column represents the x2's.

00:02:55.103 --> 00:03:00.103
I don't have an x2 in the middle row. So I have a zero there, and a seven.

00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:12.737
For the x3's, we have three, four, negative five. And then to the right of the augmented bar, we have the terms that did not have any variables.

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:18.737
So what we end up with here is we started off with the vector equation.

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:27.737
We've also written this as a system. Equations or a system of scalar equations.

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:33.737
We've also written this as an augmented matrix.

00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:41.169
And depending on our context, it's going to be useful to be able to use all three of these different representations of the same thing.
